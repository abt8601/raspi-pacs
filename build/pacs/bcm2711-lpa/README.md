Peripheral access crate for BCM2711 found in the Raspberry Pi 4.

This PAC is generated by [`svd2rust`](https://crates.io/crates/svd2rust)
from the
[SVD file](https://github.com/adafruit/broadcom-peripherals/blob/d3a6b50a21e7dd49ba4bfa0374da3407594caa50/svd/gen/bcm2711_lpa.svd)
in
[adafruit/broadcom-peripherals@d3a6b50](https://github.com/adafruit/broadcom-peripherals/tree/d3a6b50a21e7dd49ba4bfa0374da3407594caa50).
save that a patch is applied to add the missing tags required by `svd2rust`.

## A Note on Virtual Memory

This PAC expects the memory-mapped registers of the peripherals
to be present on their physical addresses;
therefore, this PAC integrates poorly with virtual memory.
If the register files are offset-mapped to a different base address,
it is advised to generate the PAC by yourself from our patched SVD file
and using the `--base-address-shift` option of `svd2rust`.
See the
[repository-level README](https://github.com/abt8601/raspi-pacs/blob/main/README.md)
for more information on generating PACs.

## Feature Flags

- `atomic`:
  Extends the register API with operations
  to atomically set, clear, and toggle specific bits.
- `defmt`:
  Include `defmt::Format` implementations.
